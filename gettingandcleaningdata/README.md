# Getting and Cleaning Data
#### Peer-graded Assignment submitted for John Hopkins University's MOOC *"Getting and Cleaning Data"* on Coursera

### Objective
To demonstrate the candidate's ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

### Requirements
The peer-graded assignments requires the following submissions:
1. A tidy data set as a text file
2. A [GitHub repo](https://github.com/nadeemnajeeb/gettingandcleaningdata) with the R Script that performs the cleaning
3. A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data

### Data Source
The [data](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) is from accelerometers from Samsung Galaxy S phones

### Checklist
The R Script must
1. Merge the training and test datasets to create one dataset
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
